## Initial commands to import during startup

All Hyperlambda files in this folder, will be initially imported during startup as commands, if there exists
no existing "commands" in your database. This allows you to distribute Magic Menu with a bunch
of pre-existing commands, and have these automatically imported during the initial startup.
