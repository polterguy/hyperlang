# Magic Menu

Magic Menu is an Ajax navbar and menu system, working across all your Phosphorus Five 
apps, allowing you to easily navigate your apps, and associate small pieces of Hyperlambda with
some _"navbar"_ item. It is extremly configurable, and among other things features speech
recoginition and speech synthesis to navigate your menu structure on browsers that
supports such things.

The aboce traits, makes it extremely configurable, and arguably allows you to use
a single navbar, for every app you create. Below is a screenshot of how it looks like.

It will show up in the lower left corner once instantiated, and become a _"single navbar"_,
arguably allowing you to configure it to work with every single Phosphorus Five apps
you create.

It basically allows you to create new menu items, during usage, as long as you're
logged in as _"root"_, from where you can associate small snippets of Hyperlambda,
with natural language, which will be evaluated once your sentence or phrase is somehow
chosen.

This allows you to create literally hundreds of thousands of menu items if you wish,
letting the menu intelligently decide for itself, which items to display at any given
moment in time. Since the menu only displays the 5 last used items, it requires little
_"real estate"_ on your screen, yet still easily through its searching interface, allows you
to rapidly find whatever menu item you're actually looking for.

As an additional bonus, it can be set into accepting natural speech as input, and provide
output with speech synthesis. Although these features are for all practical concerns limited
to Google Chrome, since this is the only browser that adequately implements the W3C
Speech API.
